This repository aims to implement a fully-functional lightsaber in CircuitPython using an MPU 6500, and an I2S audio interface. It also includes a momentary switch to toggle states, as well as switch profiles.

An additional boot.py is required to allow CircuitPython to change files in the onboard storage.

The code is functional, but requires 10MB of flash storage on the RP2040 chip.
Additional code cleanup is yet to be done, along with a demo.
